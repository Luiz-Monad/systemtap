completion (M-C-i) functionality desired:

- kernel.  <M-C-i>                           should expand to probe point components that may follow
                                             kernel., such as function. etc.

- syscall.r <M-C-i>                          should expand to second-level probe points under syscall.*
                                             that start with r, i.e., as if   stap -l 'syscall.r*'

- process("/bin/ls").function("ma   <M-C-i>  should expand to main etc.
  process("/bin/ls").function("ma*  <M-C-i>  should expand to main, not "ma*n", i.e., eat the last * token

- probe foo { println($  <M-C-i>           should expand to $context variables available in foo
                                           as if  stap -L 'foo'

- global bar
  probe foo { println(b  <M-C-i>           should expand to bar and/or other variables in context,
                                           as well as functions
