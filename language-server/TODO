completion (M-C-i for emacs) functionality desired:

- process("/bin/ls").function("ma   <M-C-i>  should expand to main etc.
  - Works on jupyter, emacs, vscode, not vim-lsp (small bug on client side) 

- probe foo { println($  <M-C-i>           should expand to $context variables available in foo
                                           as if  stap -L 'foo'

- Add a timeout on completion which take longer than k ms (Ex. completing kernel.function("mem))
